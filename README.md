## MOVIE TRAILER WEBSITE

This is the first project of the [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://in.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004/?).

Basically,it consists of writing a server-side code to store a list of my favorite movies, including their respective poster and trailer URL. The code was written in `python-2.7.11`, and it was used to generate a Static Web page.


## How do I run this?

Download and run `fresh_tomatoes.py`, or directly open the` html` file named `fresh_tomatoes.html.`
To execute files with `.py` extension, it's necessary to have Python installed. If you don't have Python installed on your computer, go to [http://python.org] (http://python.org) and install it.

||Is the page error free?|Yes|
|Code Quality|Is the code ready for personal review and neatly formatted according to the Python [PEP-8](http://pep8online.com/) Guidelines?|Mostly yes. Deliberately skipped a few [E501](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length) errors due to long Image URLs|
